//  A student has established the following monthly budget:
//
//      Housing                 $500.00
//      Utilities               $150.00
//      Household Expenses      $65.00
//      Transportation          $50.00
//      Food                    $250.00
//      Medical                 $30.00
//      Insurance               $100.00
//      Entertainment           $150.00
//      Clothing                $75.00
//      Miscellaneous           $50.00
//
//  Write a program that has a MonthlyBudget structure designed to hold each of these
//  expense categories. The program should pass the structure to a function that asks the
//  user to enter the amounts spent in each budget category during a month. The program
//  should then pass the structure to a function that displays a report indicating the
//  amount over or under in each category, as well as the amount over or under for the
//  entire monthly budget.
